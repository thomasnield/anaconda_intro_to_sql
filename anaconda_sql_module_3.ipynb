But we do need quotes around text values so the SQL engine does not get confused looking for that value as a column or table name. \n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"dmAE9nv7_-hW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sql = \"\"\"\n","\n","SELECT * FROM WEATHER_MONITOR\n","WHERE REPORT_CODE = 'YJA6G3I'\n","\n","\"\"\"\n","\n","pd.read_sql(sql, conn)\n"],"metadata":{"id":"C1ygXZYC_-nA","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":81},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666721877036,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":138,"user":{"displayName":"Daisy Wizda","userId":"00043830702421473023"}},"outputId":"b47e2e43-28e1-4504-d06c-d442eb14a722"},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["     ID REPORT_CODE REPORT_DATE  LOCATION_ID  TEMPERATURE  OVERCAST  RAIN  \\\n","0  2511     YJA6G3I  2020-11-25           20         92.6         1   0.0   \n","\n","   SNOW  LIGHTNING  HAIL  TORNADO  \n","0   0.0          0     0        0  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-49d596ab-d071-434b-bf4f-0567f388a86c\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>ID</th>\n","      <th>REPORT_CODE</th>\n","      <th>REPORT_DATE</th>\n","      <th>LOCATION_ID</th>\n","      <th>TEMPERATURE</th>\n","      <th>OVERCAST</th>\n","      <th>RAIN</th>\n","      <th>SNOW</th>\n","      <th>LIGHTNING</th>\n","      <th>HAIL</th>\n","      <th>TORNADO</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>2511</td>\n","      <td>YJA6G3I</td>\n","      <td>2020-11-25</td>\n","      <td>20</td>\n","      <td>92.6</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0.0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-49d596ab-d071-434b-bf4f-0567f388a86c')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-49d596ab-d071-434b-bf4f-0567f388a86c button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
